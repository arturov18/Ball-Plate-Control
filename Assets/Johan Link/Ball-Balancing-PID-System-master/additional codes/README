The program "solveEquation.py" generates the file "data.txt". You can find the file "data.txt" in the folder "pythonCodes" so you do not need to use the code "solveEquation.py" unless you want to generate the file "data.txt" yourself. To use the code "solveEquation.py" you have to create a .txt file and indicate the path of the file on line 64 of the python code.

The program "programmeIntermediare.py" is just a program that can test color detection with OpenCV.If you run this program, a window opens with the video of your webcam and if you click on a color then a yellow circle will surround that color.
