# Ball-Plate-Control
This is a project done for a Master Thesis in the Electromechanical Engineering (specialization: Mechatronics), it is about the design and control of a Ball and Plate Didactic Device. This device is intended to be developed into a Commercial device and maybe sold to educational institutes or young apprentices in the field of Control Systems. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

things you need to install before running the code:
- Arduino ide
- Python 3.7
- Python PiP
- A Python ide (Pycharm is recommended)

Run the following commands in your command terminal after install "PIP"
```
pip install opencv-python 3.4.5.20
pip install Django
pip install Pillow
pip install image
pip install imutils
pip install numpy
pip install pyserial
pip install pytz
pip install setuptools
pip install sqlparse
pip install wheel
```

## Deployment

- Make sure you run the solveequation.py code first to generate the dictionary file.
- Then place the dictionary file in the same directory of the interface.py code.
- Connect an Arduino and upload the arduino code (Full_Program.ino) using the arduino IDE
- Make sure you have a Camera attached on your system.
- Run the code interface.py . 

## Simulation Files
The simulation files are found in the (Software/Matlab & Simulation/)
