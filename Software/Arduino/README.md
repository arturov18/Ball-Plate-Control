#Arduino Files
To run the plant with the GUI you will be only needing the "Full_Program.ino" files.
The rest of the codes are only to test partially some functionalities of the equipments used for the plant.
You can notice that there is a file for the touchscreen, however, this was discontinued due to the extreme sensor noise.

## Caution 
All of these files are calibrated for a certain sensor and actuator that the Author owns. 
You should modify the calibration part of the code when using your own hardware.
