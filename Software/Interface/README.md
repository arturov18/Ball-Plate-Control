# Interface (GUI)
The "interface.py" file is the code that contains entirely the GUI code, However, you should make sure that the lookup table which is the text file called "data.txt" is present within this directory to ensure that the code runs.
Another thing you should check is that a functional camera is attached to your system otherwise you will get opencv errors.
Lastly, you have the option to plot and record readings in realtime while using the GUI which will be stored in the "log.txt" file. This log file can be used with matlab later on to compare graphs.

##Additional information
The "Gettime.py" is just a simple code to record time delays between the GUI and the Arduino. You might actually never use this code, so please ignore it if you find it useless.
