# Lookup Table Generation
Due to the non linear relation between the angle Alpha and Theta, a lookup table can be generated to map between these to angles by running the "solveEquation.py".
The generated file "data.txt" needs to be placed in the interface directory afterwards if you intend it to be used by the GUI.

## Caution
The "solveEquation.py" is manually adjusted to cope with the non linearities of the Author's actuator. So make sure you read it and understand it well, and then modify it to work with your actuator.
